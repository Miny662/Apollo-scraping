# Apollo Quota Reset Strategy

## The Issue
Apollo's free plan limitations are tied to your **account**, not browser sessions. Even restarting the browser doesn't reset the quota.

## Current Status
✅ Successfully collected: 75 records (Pages 1-3)
❌ Blocked after page 3 due to plan limitations

## Strategies to Get All 18 Pages

### 1. **Account Rotation** (Most Effective)
- Create multiple Apollo accounts with different emails
- Rotate between accounts every 3 pages
- Each account gets ~75 records before hitting limit

### 2. **Time-Based Collection** (Free Approach)
- Apollo quotas may reset daily/weekly
- Run script once per day
- Collect 3 pages per day over 6 days

### 3. **Upgrade Plan** (Guaranteed)
- Upgrade to Apollo paid plan
- Removes search limitations entirely
- Most reliable for immediate access to all data

### 4. **Corporate Email Strategy**
- Use corporate domain email (not gmail/yahoo)
- Corporate domains often have higher limits
- May bypass free account restrictions

## Current Data Collected
- **75 total records** from pages 1-3
- **Files saved**: 
  - `apollo_restart_people_[timestamp].json`
  - `apollo_restart_contacts_[timestamp].json` 
  - `apollo_restart_extracted_[timestamp].json`

## Recommendation
For immediate full access: **Upgrade Apollo plan**
For free approach: **Implement daily collection schedule**
